# Diabetes Prediction using Classical Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.  
Two classical supervised learning algorithms — Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) — are implemented and compared.

The goal is to understand how linear classifiers perform on a real-world healthcare dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Database
- Total Records: 768
- Features: 8 medical attributes
- Target Variable: Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Handle invalid zero values using median imputation
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Apply feature scaling
6. Train Logistic Regression and LDA models
7. Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
8. Compare models using ROC-AUC curves

---

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression and LDA showed similar performance
- ROC-AUC ≈ 0.80
- Linear models provided good baseline performance

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Classical linear models can effectively predict diabetes using structured medical data.  
This project demonstrates a clean end-to-end machine learning workflow.
